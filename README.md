# Astral Instability - Ludum Dare 49

Theme: Unstable 

Uh oh! You were astral projecting and the connection to your body was severed! Astral bodies cannot survive for long without a real body, so you will have to possess various objects to get back to your physical self. But be careful, your lifeforce is incompatible with these objects so you cannot stay in a single object for too long!

You can use the arrow keys to move and spacebar to perform actions.
